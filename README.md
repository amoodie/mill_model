### `stratify.m`
This is a direct reimplementation of the parker ebook RTe-bookSuspSedDensityStrat in Matlab.
Note that even this code relies on a settling velocity calculator defined in [`get_DSV.m` in another Matlab file located here.](https://github.com/amoodie/Matlab_programs/blob/master/get_DSV.m)
